# 29/10/2025
* Bug fix:
  * [Fixed] Multi session with YRC 1000 - fixed by using "with" for initializing OPCUA client
  * Cannot send data from python script to PLC data block tags -> Solution: Use OPCUA interface within TIA Portal to access these data tags
  * Control delay due to constant command pooling
- TODO:
  * Robot cannot move backwards because camera can only see forward --> need a solution
  * Clean the code before move on
