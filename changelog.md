* Bug fix:
  * Multi session with YRC 1000 - fixed by using "with" for initializing OPCUA client
  * Cannot send data from python script to PLC data block tags -> Solution: Use OPCUA interface within TIA Portal to access these data tags
- TODO:
  * Robot cannot move backwards because camera can only see forward --> need a solution
